• Make a class in a separate file with private fields, public getters and setters, a constructor with and without parameters
// Board class, card class, etc.
• Overload a method
// Method setFace in Card class is overloaded.
• Describe inheritance and its benefits
• Develop code that makes use of polymorphism
// The player class inherits the Board class, and makes use of the same
// fields and methods.
• Use super and this to access objects and constructors
Super is used in the player class to access the Board's add card method.
• Declare, instantiate, initialize and use a one-dimensional array
// In the main class, an array of card objects called the deck is created, capable
// Of holding 52 Card objects.
• Manually find the smallest value in an array
// Part of the integration class
• Get a sum of the values in an array using an accumulator.
// Towards the end of the main method.
• Search an array and identify the index where a value was found.
// Part of the integration class
• Create and use the enhanced for loop
// Enhanced for loop used at the end of main for the sum of an arrayList
• Declare, instantiate, initialize and use multi-dimensional arrays
// The beginning of main method, faces and suits are in a 2D array, 
// and used to create Cards.
• Declare and use an ArrayList of a given type
ArrayLists used throughout the project.
• Search a two-dimensional array and identify the coordinates where a value was found
// Part of the Integration class.
• Effectively utilize exception handling for user input of an int
// At the beginning of main, user input is taken to get a player count
// user can only enter an integer.
